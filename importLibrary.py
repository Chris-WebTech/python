Loop Exercise â€“ Rev 2 
for counter in range(start,stop,countby):
 # your code goes here
1. 5 pts - Write a function that will allow the user to enter a word, then 
using a loop (hint a for statement), print the word in reverse. Use 
sys.stdout.print() statement. 
HINT: len()
2. 5 pts - Write a function that will count all of the numbers divisible by 3 
for the set 1 - 100.
HINT - remainder
3. 5 pts Write a function that will allow the user to enter a word with upper 
case, lower case, and numbers and symbols. Count the following good letters 
(upper and lower case only), bad letters - (any other symbol or numbers). DO 
NOT USE THE COMMAND "SEARCH". For instance Aa2#4bD has four good letters and 2 
bad letters.
HINT - run the following code and use the ASCII table. You will need to loop 
and IF you think about the problem, it will be easy IF you get my drIFt.
 # run this first and observe the output
 print(chr(66))
 print(ord('A'))
4. 5 pts - Calendar Shift
Write a program that does the following: (User gets to enter how many 
positions to shift to the right (1 - 6)) You must use a loop(s). IF you think 
about the problem, it will be easy IF you get my drIFt. 
HINT: max iterations
Enter the number of positions to shift: 4
Output:
